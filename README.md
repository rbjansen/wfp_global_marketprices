# WFP global market food prices

Collects WFP global market food prices and extends it with market coordinates as well as national current exchange rates (month median). Includes staging to `cm` and `pgm`, along with some maps.

`./run.sh` to start this up. It takes a few minutes to collect the market locations and exchange rates from the WFP's API.
