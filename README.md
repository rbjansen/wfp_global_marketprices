# WFP global market food prices

Collects WFP global market food price data and extends that with market coordinates and national current exchange rates (month median).

Set up a virtualenv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`. After that, `./run.sh` to start it up. It takes a few minutes to collect the market locations and exchange rates from the WFP's API.
